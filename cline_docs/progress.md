## Known Issues
1. ~~Potential race conditions in sell operations~~ (Addressed by price validation)
2. ~~Precision issues in balance calculations~~ (Fixed with Decimal implementation)
3. Limited error handling in price source switching
4. No transaction locking mechanism
5. Basic monitoring capabilities
6. Memory usage optimization needed for long runs
7. Connection pool needs better cleanup
8. Frontend architecture needs implementation
9. Mode switching security validation required
