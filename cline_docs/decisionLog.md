# Decision Log

## Trading Mode Implementation (2025-03-10)

### Decision
Implemented clear visual distinction between Paper Trading and Real Trading modes with consistent UI feedback throughout the application.

### Context
- Users needed clear indication of trading mode to prevent accidental real trades
- System required consistent mode indicators across all operations
- Safety warnings needed for real trading mode

### Options Considered
1. Simple console log at startup
2. Continuous mode indicator in logs
3. **Chosen: Comprehensive mode indication system** âœ…
   - Banner at startup
   - Mode indicator in logs
   - Warning messages for real trading
   - Mode context in error messages

### Implementation Details
1. Code Structure:
   - Split into modular components
   - Separated concerns for better maintainability
   - Improved type safety

2. User Interface:
   - Clear mode banner at startup
   - Consistent mode indicators in logs
   - Mode-specific warnings and instructions

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Added global TRADING_MODE constant
   - Enhanced error handling with mode context
   - Improved type definitions

### Benefits
- Prevents mode confusion
- Reduces risk of accidental real trades
- Improves user experience
- Better code organization

### Risks Mitigated
- Accidental real trading in test environment
- Mode confusion during operation
- Unclear error context

### Future Considerations
1. Add mode switch command for testing
2. Enhance UI indicators in dashboard
3. Add mode persistence between sessions

## Next Steps
1. Implement liquidity monitoring strategy
2. Enhance price validation
3. Update dashboard with new features

## Notes
- All code changes are backward compatible
- Documentation updated
- Tests passing
