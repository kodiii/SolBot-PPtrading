# Decision Log

## Enhanced Wallet Balance Validation (2025-03-11)

### Decision
Implemented comprehensive wallet balance validation at multiple levels to prevent transactions without sufficient funds.

### Context
- System was processing transactions without proper balance checks
- Real trading mode needed stricter validation
- Balance information wasn't clearly visible

### Implementation Details
1. System Initialization Check:
   - Validates wallet at startup
   - Shows current balance
   - Prevents system start if balance insufficient

2. Transaction Processing Check:
   - Re-validates balance before each trade
   - Shows current balance with transaction
   - Includes fee estimation

3. Error Handling:
   - Clear error messages
   - Balance display in logs
   - Mode-specific feedback

### Benefits
- Prevents failed transactions
- Clear user feedback
- Better error prevention
- Consistent validation

### Future Considerations
- Add periodic balance checks
- Implement balance alerts
- Add auto-retry mechanism

## Modular System Architecture (2025-03-11)

### Decision
Split system initialization and wallet validation into separate modules for better organization and maintainability.

### Context
- Code was becoming too complex
- Files exceeded line limits
- Needed better separation of concerns

### Implementation
1. Created new modules:
   - src/system/initializer.ts
   - src/utils/wallet-checks.ts

2. Functionality split:
   - System initialization logic
   - Wallet validation
   - Balance checking

3. Benefits:
   - Better code organization
   - Improved maintainability
   - Clearer responsibilities

### Technical Details
1. Initialization Flow:
   ```typescript
   validateEnv() -> initializeSystem() -> initializeWallet()
   ```

2. Balance Checks:
   ```typescript
   checkWalletBalance() -> calculateRequiredAmount()
   ```

3. Trading Flow:
   ```typescript
   processTransaction() -> handleRealTrading() -> checkWalletBalance()
   ```

### Risks Mitigated
- System starting without funds
- Failed transactions
- Unclear error states

## Next Steps
1. Transaction Fee Enhancement
   - Improve fee estimation
   - Dynamic fee adjustment
   - Better fee logging

2. Balance Monitoring
   - Add periodic checks
   - Implement alerts
   - Configure thresholds

3. Error Recovery
   - Add retry mechanism
   - Improve error handling
   - Better error feedback
