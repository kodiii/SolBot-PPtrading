# Paper Trading Mode Implementation - Solana Token Sniper

This document outlines the implementation plan and configuration requirements for the paper trading (simulation) mode of the Solana Token Sniper project. In paper trading mode, users simulate trades using real-time market prices, but with a virtual balance and without executing real blockchain transactions. This allows users to test strategies and calculate potential profit and loss (PNL) without actual fund transfers.

## Configuration Requirements

### 1. Virtual Balance
- **Initial Fake SOL Balance:**  
  Configure an initial virtual SOL balance that serves as the starting capital for simulated operations.  
  _Example:_  
  ```json
  {
    "initial_virtual_balance": "10000000000" // e.g., represents 10 SOL in lamports
  }
  ```

### 2. Fee Calculations
For swap (buy) operations, use these settings for PNL calculations (using the real current price from Dexscreener):
```typescript
{
  prio_fee_max_lamports: 1000000,    // 0.001 SOL
  prio_level: "medium",              // Options: medium, veryHigh (veryHigh uses 50000000, i.e., 0.05 SOL)
  amount: "10000000",                // 0.01 SOL â€“ this value from src/config.ts will also be used to determine the purchase amount
  slippageBps: "200"                 // 2% slippage
}
```

For sell operations, apply these settings (using the current real price for simulation):
```typescript
{
  price_source: "dex",               // Options: 'dex' for Dexscreener, 'jup' for Jupiter
  prio_fee_max_lamports: 1000000,    // 0.001 SOL
  prio_level: "medium",              // Options: medium, or veryHigh (if set, uses 50000000 i.e., 0.05 SOL)
  slippageBps: "200"                 // 2% slippage
}
```

### 3. Database for Simulated Holdings
- **Location:** `src/tracker/paper_trading.db`  
  Maintain a clone of the actual holdings database specifically for simulated transactions. This ensures that virtual trades, balances, and portfolio data remain isolated from real transactions.

### 4. Integration with Existing Configurations
- Leverage the configuration settings defined in `src/config.ts`.
- **Toggle Paper Trading Mode:**  
  Use the flag `rug_check.simulation_mode` within the configuration to switch the transaction handling from real to simulated.
- **Verbose Logging:**  
  Enable detailed logging for paper trading activities using `rug_check.verbose_log`.

## Slippage Implementation (Added 22/02/2025)

The paper trading system now includes realistic slippage simulation to better match real-world trading conditions:

### 1. Slippage Calculation
- Uses configurable basis points from `config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  // For buy operations
  swap: {
    slippageBps: "200" // 2% maximum slippage
  }
  // For sell operations
  sell: {
    slippageBps: "200" // 2% maximum slippage
  }
  ```
- Converts basis points to decimal percentage (200 -> 0.02)
- Generates random slippage between 0 and maximum

### 2. Price Impact
- **Buy Operations:** Price increases by random slippage (0-2%)
  - Example: If current price is 1 SOL and slippage is 1.5%
  - Execution price becomes 1.015 SOL
- **Sell Operations:** Price decreases by random slippage (0-2%)
  - Example: If current price is 1 SOL and slippage is 1.5%
  - Execution price becomes 0.985 SOL

### 3. Trade Recording
- Stores slippage-adjusted prices in trade records
- Logs both original and slippage-adjusted prices
- Includes slippage percentage in trade logs
- Uses adjusted prices for P&L calculations

## Operational Logic

When a token is detected and passes the rug check validations, the paper trading mode will:

1. Use the current fake (virtual) SOL balance.
2. Execute buy orders using a fixed amount (configured as `"10000000"` in `src/config.ts` representing 0.01 SOL) based on the real-time price sourced from Dexscreener's API.
3. Retrieve pricing data via API endpoints such as:  
   `https://api.dexscreener.com/tokens/v1/{chainId}/{tokenAddresses}`  
   For example, a Dexscreener response may look like:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "chainId": "solana",
       "dexId": "raydium",
       "url": "https://dexscreener.com/solana/8slbnzoa1cfnvmjlpfp98zlanfsycfapfjkmbixnlwxj",
       "pairAddress": "8sLbNZoA1cfnvMJLPfp98ZLAnFSYCFApfJKMbiXNLwxj",
       "labels": ["CLMM"],
       "baseToken": {
         "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
         "name": "Wrapped SOL",
         "symbol": "SOL"
       },
       "quoteToken": {
         "address": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
         "name": "USD Coin",
         "symbol": "USDC"
       },
       "priceNative": "197.1930",
       "priceUsd": "197.19",
       "txns": { ... },
       "volume": { ... },
       "priceChange": { ... },
       "liquidity": { ... },
       "pairCreatedAt": 1723699294000
     }
   ]
   ```
4. Use the real-time price from such responses to calculate the cost, fees, slippage, and hence the simulated PNL.

## Monitoring and Analysis

### 1. CLI Dashboard
The paper trading system includes a command-line dashboard for real-time monitoring:

- **Access:** Run `npm run dashboard` to launch the monitoring interface
- **Features:**
  * Real-time virtual balance display
  * Active positions with current prices and PNL
  * Transaction history with timestamps
  * Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Visual Indicators:**
  * Color-coded profits (green) and losses (red)
  * Clear display of stop-loss and take-profit levels
  * Transaction type indicators (buy/sell)

### 2. Data Tracking
The dashboard provides real-time insights into:
- Current portfolio value
- Individual token performance
- Transaction history
- Fee calculations and impact
- Stop-loss and take-profit status

## Summary

- **Virtual Balance:** Initial virtual SOL balance for simulation.
- **Swap & Sell Fee Configs:** As specified above for PNL calculations.
- **Database:** Use `src/tracker/paper_trading.db` to store simulated transactions and portfolio data.
- **Integration:** Toggle via `rug_check.simulation_mode` with verbose logging through `rug_check.verbose_log`.
- **Operation:** When a token passes the rug check, execute a simulated buy using the fixed buy amount (`"10000000"`) based on the real price from Dexscreener.
- **Monitoring:** Access real-time performance data through the CLI dashboard using `npm run dashboard`.

## Frontend Architecture (Added 22/02/2025)

### 1. Dual Mode System
The trading platform implements a dual-mode architecture that handles both paper and real trading:

```typescript
interface TradingMode {
  type: 'paper' | 'real';
  components: ComponentRegistry;
  services: ServiceRegistry;
}

class PaperTradingMode implements TradingMode {
  type: 'paper';
  requiresWallet: false;
  // Paper trading specific implementations
}

class RealTradingMode implements TradingMode {
  type: 'real';
  requiresWallet: true;
  // Real trading specific implementations
}
```

### 2. Component Structure
- **Shared Components:**
  * Market data displays
  * Trading charts
  * Order forms
  * Alert system
  * Risk calculator

- **Paper Trading Specific:**
  * Virtual balance display
  * Simulated position tracking
  * Paper trading statistics
  * Learning tools

- **Real Trading Specific:**
  * Wallet connection
  * Transaction signing
  * Real position tracking
  * Security validations

### 3. Dashboard Improvements
The paper trading dashboard has been enhanced with:
- Configurable recent trades display (limit set in config)
- Enhanced market data integration
- Real-time price and volume tracking
- Detailed trade information display
- Comprehensive position tracking

### 4. Security Considerations
- Clear mode indicators to prevent confusion
- Mode switching validation
- No wallet connection in paper mode
- Separate state management per mode
- Isolated transaction handling

### 5. Configuration Additions
New dashboard configuration options:
```typescript
paper_trading: {
  dashboard_refresh: 5000,      // Dashboard update interval (ms)
  recent_trades_limit: 20,      // Number of recent trades to display
  max_open_positions: 5,        // Maximum number of concurrent positions
  verbose_log: false           // Enable detailed logging
}
```
