# Active Context

## Current Task
- Added trading mode indicators (Paper Trading vs Real Trading) to improve user feedback
- Implemented clear visual distinction between simulation and real trading modes
- Refactored code into modular structure for better maintainability

## Recent Changes
1. Added trading mode logging:
   - Clear banner at startup showing Paper/Real trading mode
   - Mode-specific warnings and instructions
   - Mode indicator in transaction logs
   - Visual separation between modes

2. Code Organization:
   - Split into modular structure:
     - src/websocket/handler.ts: WebSocket connection management
     - src/websocket/transaction-processor.ts: Transaction processing logic
     - src/index.ts: Main entry point
   
3. Improved Error Handling:
   - Added TypeScript type safety
   - Better error messages with mode context
   - Cleaner error logging structure

## Next Steps
1. Implement liquidity monitoring strategy:
   - Review liquidity-strategy-plan.md
   - Add liquidity tracking features
   - Implement market depth analysis

2. Enhance price validation:
   - Improve price data accuracy
   - Add cross-exchange price validation
   - Implement validation rules

3. Update dashboard:
   - Review dashboard-update-plan.md
   - Add mode indicator to UI
   - Improve trade history display

## Open Questions
1. Should we add more detailed logs for simulated trades?
2. Do we need additional safeguards for real trading mode?
3. Should we implement a mode switch command for testing?
