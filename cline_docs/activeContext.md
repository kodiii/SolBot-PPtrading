# Active Context

## Current Status
Implemented wallet balance checking for real trading mode. The system now:
1. Uses the private key wallet consistently
2. Validates balance before transactions
3. Provides clear feedback on insufficient funds

## Recent Changes
1. Added wallet-checks.ts utility:
   - Balance checking functionality
   - Clear error messaging
   - Reusable wallet validation

2. Updated transaction-processor.ts:
   - Integrated balance checks
   - Improved error handling
   - Better mode separation

3. Documentation Updates:
   - Added implementation decisions
   - Updated progress tracking
   - Documented next steps

## Next Steps
Based on priority, the next tasks are:

1. Transaction Fee Enhancement
   - Add fee estimation to balance check
   - Include transaction costs in required amount
   - Consider gas price fluctuations

2. Retry Mechanism
   - Implement balance retry logic
   - Add exponential backoff
   - Set maximum retry attempts

3. Balance Notification System
   - Add low balance warnings
   - Implement alert thresholds
   - Configure notification channels

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Review transaction fee calculation in handleRealTrading
- [ ] Design retry mechanism for balance checks
- [ ] Plan notification system architecture

## Open Questions
1. Should we include gas estimation in balance checks?
2. What should be the retry limits and backoff strategy?
3. What notification methods should we implement?

## Notes
- All wallet operations use PRIV_KEY_WALLET
- Balance checks occur before transaction creation
- Error messages include current and required balance
