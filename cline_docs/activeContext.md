# Active Context

## Current Work (2025-03-11)
- Refactored SimulationService into smaller, focused services
- Created PriceTracker, TradeExecutor, and StrategyManager services
- Improved separation of concerns and maintainability
- Added proper exports and type definitions

## Recent Changes
1. Created new service modules:
   - PriceTracker: Price monitoring and updates
   - TradeExecutor: Buy/sell operations
   - StrategyManager: Strategy coordination
   - SimulationService: Service orchestration

2. Added proper type exports
3. Updated documentation in decisionLog.md

## Next Steps
1. Unit Tests
   - Write tests for PriceTracker
   - Write tests for TradeExecutor
   - Write tests for StrategyManager
   - Update SimulationService tests

2. Service Improvements
   - Add service interfaces
   - Consider strategy-specific configuration
   - Add error handling for service coordination
   - Add logging for service interactions

3. Documentation
   - Create sequence diagrams for service interactions
   - Document service APIs
   - Update technical documentation

4. Code Quality
   - Add input validation for all services
   - Add monitoring hooks for service health
   - Consider adding service metrics

## Open Questions
1. Should we add more granular error handling for each service?
2. Do we need explicit interfaces for future service implementations?
3. Should we add service health monitoring?
4. Should strategy configuration be moved to its own file?

## Current Status
âœ… Basic service separation complete
âœ… Core functionality preserved
ðŸš§ Tests needed
ðŸš§ Documentation updates needed
ðŸš§ Interface definitions needed
